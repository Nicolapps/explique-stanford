# no-name-ai

Base example based on: https://gitlab.com/epfl-isasfsd/passport-tequila/-/tree/master/examples/express-passport?ref_type=heads

Note: The app.tsx is just an example. The idea behind that is to be sure that you're correctly querying the endpoint on the backend that is reading your tequila user. Refers to the tequila-passport documentation to know how to use it.
